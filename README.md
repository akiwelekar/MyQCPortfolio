# 🧠 Quantum Computing Problem Solving Portfolio

This repository showcases hands-on problem solving using quantum computing. It covers a range of topics such as quantum algorithms, QUBO modelling, optimization, and quantum machine learning using tools like Qiskit, D-Wave Ocean SDK, and PennyLane.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Grover's Algorithm and Oracle-based Search
- Optimization using QUBO and Quantum Annealing (D-Wave)
- Real-world problems (TSP, Exam logistics)
- Quantum ML (VQC, Quantum PCA)
- Hybrid Quantum-Classical Systems
